# Pitch Script: From Tool to Command Center

**Context:** Use this during the last 30 minutes of the Taster Session.
**Setup:** You have just successfully run the "Receipt Sniffer" on their laptop. The room is high on dopamine.

## 1. The Acknowledgement (The Hook)
"Look at your screen. You just built a functional piece of AI infrastructure in 120 minutes. You aren't 'chatting' with a bot; you've authored a machine that solves a real business pain point. You are now an Architect."

## 2. The Bridge (The Gap)
"But here is the truth: A CEO with 5 separate scripts is just a CEO with 5 new chores. To truly scale your intelligence, you don't need a toolbox. You need a **Cockpit.**"

## 3. The Visual Reveal (The Georgetown Cockpit)
*Display the visual mockup on the big screen.*

"Imagine this is your phone. This is what we build in the **48-Hour Weekend Intensive** here in Georgetown."

**Point to the 'Magic Bar':**
"No more clicking through Xero or HubSpot. You type one command here—'What was my net margin last week?'—and your private database answers you in seconds."

**Point to the 'Meeting Wingman':**
"15 minutes before your next call, this widget updates. It's 'sniffed' the person's latest LinkedIn news and cross-referenced it with your past emails. You walk into that room with a 10-year memory."

**Point to the 'Oracle':**
"This is the heart of the machine. It doesn't wait for you to ask. It analyzes your data and gives you 5 strategic suggestions every morning. It's the partner that never sleeps."

## 4. The 48-Hour Promise
"On Saturday, we build your **External Brain**. We take every strategy doc, financial sheet, and transcript you own and move them into a private, local vault. No cloud leaks. Just pure intelligence."

"On Sunday, we build the **Ghost Staff**. We set the triggers so this cockpit runs while your laptop is closed. By 5 PM Sunday, you ship your system and 'Glide' home."

## 5. The Close (The Multiplier)
"There are only 12 seats at this table for the next intake. We keep it small so we can build **your** specific business machine together."

"This taster cost you RM 250. If you lock in your seat today, I’m applying a 4X multiplier to that. Your RM 250 becomes a **RM 1,000 credit** toward the Intensive."

"Stop renting other people's software. Start owning your own. Who's taking the first seat?"
