# LinkedIn Post: The AI Architect vs. The Coder

**Asset Required:** 45-second screen recording of terminal build.

Most CEOs are using AI as a better "Chatbot."
I'm teaching them to use it as a better "Staff."

Last night, I watched a founder build a custom **Financial Intelligence Sniffer** in under 3 hours. 

No outsourcing. No RM 50k agency fees. No manual data entry.

He didn't learn Python syntax. He didn't learn how to "code" in the traditional sense. 
He learned how to be an **AI Architect**.

He learned to command a terminal to orchestrate a machine that "sniffs" his messy receipts, extracts the logic, and builds a real-time report while he sleeps.

Software is an opinion. Stop renting other people's opinions and start coding your own.

I’m opening the **code:zero Academy** in a heritage lab on Malay Street, George Town.

I'm hosting three 3-hour "Initiation" sessions for 8 founders only. 
Filter fee: RM 250.
The win: You build your first sensor and keep the code.
