### Course 1: Consumer — Ship Sprint (4 Weeks)

**Positioning:** Inspired by Marc Lou (CodeFast, ShipFast). Not a bootcamp — a forcing function for builders who want to ship.

> "Bought courses but never finished? Join 12 builders in Penang for 4 weeks. You WILL ship — we make sure of it."

**Target audience:**
- Entrepreneurs building their own product
- Career changers ready to commit
- Developers who want to ship, not just learn
- International travelers ("builder's retreat")
- People who bought courses but never finished

**What students build:**
Their own product with AI-powered features:
- Email marketing automation
- Data analytics dashboards
- LLM-powered content generation
- n8n workflow automation
- **Shipped, deployed, live product by Week 4**

**Delivery:**
- 4 weeks, weekdays only (weekends off)
- Live afternoons (in-person, Penang)
- Online mornings (async/remote component)
- Hybrid combats learning fatigue
- 20 teaching days total

**Pricing:**
- **RM 9,800** per person (~$2,100 USD)
- ~$500/week — premium but accessible
- Revenue per cohort: RM 78K - 147K (8-15 pax)

**vs. Marc Lou's products:**
| Marc Lou | code:zero |
|----------|-----------|
| Self-paced, $200-400 | Live cohort, RM 9,800 |
| You might finish | You WILL ship |
| Alone at computer | 12 builders + Penang |
| No accountability | Daily structure + instructors |

**International angle:**
Marketed as **"Builder's Retreat"** — 4 weeks in Penang. Ship your product + experience SEA.

### Course 2: Enterprise — AI Automation Sprint (3 Days)

**Target audience:**
- Corporate dev teams needing AI upskilling
- Companies with HRDF levy to utilize
- Engineering managers upskilling their squad

**What teams build:**
Working AI automation they can deploy immediately:
- n8n + LLM workflows
- Internal tools with AI
- Automated reporting/analytics

**Delivery:**
- 3 days intensive (9am - 4:30pm)
- On-site at client office OR Penang hub
- 6 hours instruction/day, 50% hands-on

**Pricing:**
- **RM 38,000** per cohort of 8-12 (~$8,100 USD)
- HRDF claimable (potentially zero cost for Malaysian SMEs)
- Per-day rate: ~$2,700/day (competitive enterprise rate)

**Sales approach:**
- Free 1-hour taster session to demonstrate value
- Pilot pricing for early adopters willing to provide case studies
- See `/enterprise/` folder for sales materials

### Revenue Comparison

| | Consumer (4-week) | Enterprise (3-day) |
|--|-------------------|-------------------|
| Revenue/cohort (10 pax) | RM 98,000 | RM 38,000 |
| Your time | 20 days | 3 days |
| Revenue/day of teaching | RM 4,900 | RM 12,667 |
| Cohorts possible/year | ~20 | ~48 |
| Annual potential | RM 1.96M | RM 1.8M |
| Sales effort | Marketing to individuals | Relationship-based B2B |
| Fill risk | Need 8-15 individuals | 1 client = full cohort |

**Why 4 weeks is better than 6 weeks:**
- Similar annual revenue potential
- 33% less of your time per cohort
- Higher revenue per teaching day (RM 4,900 vs RM 4,600)
- Easier commitment for students
- More cohorts possible per year
- "Ship fast" positioning = premium, not discount

**Strategy:** Start with Consumer (faster revenue, builds case studies), layer in Enterprise once you have proof points.

---

### Class Size
**8-15 students** (Consumer) / **8-12 people** (Enterprise)
Small enough for attention, large enough for community.

### Location
**Penang, Malaysia** — Tourist destination enables "holiday learning" angle for international students.

## 3. Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors
- Traditional coding bootcamps
- Other AI/web dev courses
- Online course creators in the space

### Indirect Competitors
- YouTube tutorials (free but scattered)
- University CS programs (theory-heavy, slow)
- Figuring it out alone (common but frustrating)
- Corporate training programs

### Our Differentiation

**We teach like business people, not coding monkeys.**

| Them | Us |
|------|-----|
| Textbook concepts | Battle-tested workflows |
| Outdated stacks | **Latest tech used by real entrepreneurs** |
| University fresh grads teaching | Working engineers, CTOs, coding entrepreneurs |
| Learn to code for a corporation | Learn to build products and businesses |
| Theory first | Build something usable immediately |
| Become a coder waiting for instructions | Become a builder who ships |

**Instructors have real-world experience in:**
- Product design
- Graphic design
- Full stack web development
- SEO
- Even door-to-door sales

This cross-functional experience means we teach the FULL picture of shipping products, not just syntax.

### What We're NOT
- NOT theory-heavy (you build from day one)
- NOT training you to be a corporate code monkey
- NOT taught by people who only know textbooks
- NOT about getting a job at a big company
- NOT another tutorial you won't finish

### Current Stage
**Pre-launch** - Working on setup budget, building curriculum

### Team
- Team of coding entrepreneurs and engineers
- Real-world experience across multiple domains
- Not a solo founder operation
- Instructor details: TBD

## 5. Marketing & Growth

### Current Channels
- Social media
- Paid advertising
- Search (SEO)

### Best Performing Content
Unknown yet - pre-launch, still testing

### Content Strategy
TBD - building foundation

### Brand Presence
- Team-fronted, not faceless
- "By a team of coding entrepreneurs and engineers with real world experience"
- Not personality-driven around one founder

---

## 6. Brand & Voice

### Brand Personality
- Direct and no-bullshit
- Builder-to-builder
- Slightly edgy, anti-establishment (anti-bootcamp, anti-corporate)
- Practical and outcome-focused
- Confident but not arrogant

### Core Message
**"Coders just know how to code, not build things."**

We teach you to BUILD and SHIP, not just write code.

### Words We Use *[DRAFT - needs founder review]*
- Ship, Build, Launch
- Freedom
- Real-world, battle-tested
- Latest, cutting-edge
- Entrepreneurs, builders
- AI-powered

### Words We Avoid *[DRAFT - needs founder review]*
- Learn to code (too generic)
- Bootcamp (we're not that)
- Career placement (not our focus)
- Comprehensive curriculum (sounds academic)
- Revolutionary, game-changing (hype words)

---

## 7. Goals & Priorities

### 90-Day Priority
**Complete the combined Full Stack + AI course syllabus** - 9-day curriculum needs to be finalized

### 12-Month Vision
- Fully booked for the entire year
- Expanded to bigger location with more classes
- Thriving community with rave reviews
- Become THE "in" place - trendy as a startup and learning hub

## 8. Founder/Team Context

### Credibility
The team has cross-functional experience that most coding instructors lack:
- Product design
- Graphic design

- SEO
- Sales (including door-to-door)

This means teaching the full product-building skillset, not just code.

### Philosophy
**"We think and teach like business people, not coding monkeys."**

### Brand Voice
Team-fronted: "us" and "we", not a single personality
