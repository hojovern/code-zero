# code:zero Brand Voice

Apply these guidelines to ALL content created for code:zero — website copy, social posts, emails, blog articles, presentations, and any other communications.

## Core Brand Voice

### Tone
Professional yet approachable, practical, results-focused.

### Personality Traits
- **Confident but not arrogant** — We know our stuff, but we're not condescending
- **Helpful and supportive** — We're here to help builders succeed
- **Clear and direct** — No fluff, no filler, get to the point
- **Optimistic and encouraging** — Building is hard, we make it feel achievable
- **Data-informed** — Claims backed by results, not hype

---

## Voice Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Cleverness
- Use plain language that anyone can understand
- Avoid marketing jargon and buzzwords
- If a simpler word works, use it
- Explain technical concepts in accessible terms

**Do:** "Learn to build apps with AI"
**Don't:** "Leverage cutting-edge AI paradigms to architect next-gen solutions"

### 2. Action-Oriented
- Lead with verbs: Build, Ship, Launch, Learn, Create
- Focus on what the reader will DO, not abstract concepts
- Every piece of content should have a clear next step

**Do:** "Ship your first product in 4 weeks"
**Don't:** "Our program facilitates product development journeys"

### 3. Outcome-Focused
- Lead with the result, not the process
- Answer "what's in it for me?" immediately
- Emphasize transformation: before → after

**Do:** "Walk away with skills that pay forever"
**Don't:** "Comprehensive curriculum covering multiple technologies"

### 4. Builder-to-Builder
- Write like you're talking to a peer, not a customer
- Use "you" and "we" — never "users" or "clients"
- Assume intelligence, don't over-explain
- Share real talk, not sales talk

### 5. Concise by Default
- Shorter is better
- One idea per sentence
- Cut any word that doesn't add meaning
- If it can be said in 5 words, don't use 10
