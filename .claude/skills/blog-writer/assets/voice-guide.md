# code:zero Brand Voice Guide

Write like a builder talking to another builder. Direct, specific, no fluff.

---

## Core Philosophy

- **Ship > Think** — Bias toward action
- **Outcomes > Features** — What they'll achieve, not what it does
- **Specifics > Promises** — Concrete details, not vague claims
- **Builder-to-builder** — Peer conversation, not sales pitch

---

## DO

### Use Imperatives
- Build, Ship, Launch, Deploy, Create, Automate
- "Build your first agent" not "You could consider building an agent"

### Lead with Outcomes
- "Ship in 2 weeks, not 2 months"
- "Cut deploy time from 4 hours to 15 minutes"
- "Go from idea to revenue in 30 days"

### Give Specifics
- Tool names: "Use Supabase for auth"
- Timelines: "Setup takes 30 minutes"
- Costs: "Free tier handles 10K requests/month"
- Numbers: "3 API calls, 47 lines of code"

### Address Builders Directly
- "You" and "your project"
- "Here's exactly how to..."
- "The code looks like this..."

### Be Slightly Edgy
- Challenge conventional wisdom
- Call out what doesn't work
- Take clear positions

---

## DON'T

### No Buzzwords
Banned words/phrases:
- Revolutionary, game-changing, cutting-edge
- Best-in-class, world-class, industry-leading
- Synergy, leverage (as verb), optimize (without specifics)
- Disruptive, innovative (unless earned)
- Unlock, unleash, empower

### No Vague Promises
Avoid:
- "Unlock your potential"
- "Transform your business"
- "Take it to the next level"
- "Achieve your dreams"

### No Fluffy Intros
Never start with:
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "Have you ever wondered..."
- "It's no secret that..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "When it comes to..."

### No Academic Tone
Avoid:
- "It should be noted that..."
- "Research indicates..."
- "One might consider..."
- "It is important to understand..."

### No Passive Voice (Usually)
- "We built this" not "This was built"
- "You'll deploy the app" not "The app will be deployed"
