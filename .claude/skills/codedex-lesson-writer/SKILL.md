# Codedex Style Lesson Writing

This skill enables the generation of educational content that mimics the specific tone, structure, and flow of Codedex lessons.

## Core Principles

For a deep dive into the specific linguistic patterns, see `TONE_GUIDE.md` in this directory.

### 1. The Hook
Every lesson starts with a friendly greeting and a hook that relates the technical concept to a fun or real-world scenario.
*Example*: "Welcome to the first chapter of your data adventure! 🏔️"

### 2. Micro-Learning (The "Learn" Section)
- No paragraph should exceed 3 lines.
- Use bold text for technical terms the first time they appear.
- Insert an emoji at the end of key sentences to maintain an upbeat mood.

### 3. Minimalist Code
- Snippets should be under 10 lines of code.
- Variable names should be descriptive and fun (e.g., `my_pet_dragon`, `pizza_toppings`).
- Comment only where absolutely necessary.

### 4. Creative Exercises
- Instead of "Write a function that returns X," use "Help the space explorer calculate their fuel! 🚀"
- Always provide clear, step-by-step instructions.

## Prompting Snippet

When using this skill, ensure the following constraints are met:
- Use exactly 3 emojis in the "Learn" section.
- The "Exercise" must have a creative name.
- The "Instructions" must be a numbered list.
- End with the "FEATURE UNLOCKED!" block.

## Examples of Codedex Tone
- "You're doing great! (ﾉ ◕ ヮ ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ ✧"
- "Python is like a super-powered calculator that also knows how to talk to the internet. 🤖"
- "Don't worry if it doesn't click right away—learning to code is a marathon, not a sprint! 🏃💨"
