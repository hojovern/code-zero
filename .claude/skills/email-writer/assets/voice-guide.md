# code:zero Email Voice Guide

## Core Principles

### 1. Builder-to-Builder
Write like you're talking to a fellow builder, not a customer. We're peers working toward the same goal: shipping products.

**Do:** "Ready to finally ship that idea you've been sitting on?"
**Don't:** "Are you looking for an opportunity to learn coding?"

### 2. Direct & Clear
Get to the point. Respect the reader's time. No filler.

**Do:** "March intake opens Monday. 12 spots."
**Don't:** "We are excited to announce that we are opening registration for our upcoming March cohort..."

### 3. Action-Oriented
Every email should drive action. Make it obvious what to do next.

**Do:** "Apply now - we review applications in 48 hours."
**Don't:** "Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about applying."

### 4. Authentic Urgency
Only create urgency when it's real. Fake scarcity destroys trust.

**Do:** "4 spots left for March" (when true)
**Don't:** "ACT NOW!!! LIMITED TIME ONLY!!!"

## Email Structure

### Subject Line
- Under 50 characters
- One idea only
- Numbers perform well ("Ship in 4 weeks")
- Questions create curiosity ("Ready to ship?")
- Personalization when it fits ("{{firstName}}, your spot is waiting")

### Preview Text
- Complement the subject, don't repeat
- Under 90 characters
- Add context or intrigue

### Opening Line
- Skip "Hope this email finds you well"
- Get straight to value
- Make it about them, not us

**Good opens:**
- "You've been thinking about building something."
- "Week 2 starts tomorrow."
- "47 founders shipped last month. Here's how."

### Body
- 150-300 words ideal
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- One CTA, placed early
- Bullet points for lists
- White space is your friend

### CTA Button
- Action verb + outcome
- "Apply Now" not "Click Here"
- "Start Building" not "Learn More"
- One primary CTA only

### Sign-off
- Keep it short
- "See you in Penang," or "Keep building,"
- Include team name or founder name

## Formatting

### HTML Emails
- Button: Green gradient (#04A459 → #038f4d)
- Font: System fonts (no custom fonts)
- Width: Max 600px
- Padding: Generous (40px+)

### Plain Text
- Always include
- Format links: "Apply: https://..."
- Use dashes for bullets

## Personalization

Available variables:
- `{{firstName}}` - First name (fallback: "there")
- `{{name}}` - Full name
- `{{email}}` - Email address
- `{{courseName}}` - Enrolled course name
- `{{unsubscribeUrl}}` - Required in footer

## Email Types

### 1. Intake Promotion
**Goal:** Drive applications
**Tone:** Exciting but not hype-y
**CTA:** Apply Now
**Key elements:** Spots remaining, start date, outcomes

### 2. Welcome/Onboarding
**Goal:** Set expectations, build excitement
**Tone:** Warm, supportive
**CTA:** Start your first lesson
**Key elements:** What to expect, how to succeed, community

### 3. Re-engagement
**Goal:** Bring back inactive users
**Tone:** Understanding, supportive (not guilt-trippy)
**CTA:** Resume where you left off
**Key elements:** Progress reminder, support offer

### 4. Milestone/Achievement
**Goal:** Celebrate and encourage
**Tone:** Celebratory but genuine
**CTA:** Share or continue
**Key elements:** Specific achievement, next steps

### 5. Announcement
**Goal:** Inform about something new
**Tone:** Exciting, clear
**CTA:** Learn more or take action
**Key elements:** What's new, why it matters, what to do

## Examples

### Good Email

```
Subject: Ship your product in 4 weeks

Hey {{firstName}},

You've been thinking about building something. The March intake is your chance to finally do it.

In 4 weeks, you'll go from idea to shipped product. Not a tutorial project—a real thing that solves a real problem.

**What you'll build:**
- Full-stack web app with AI features
- Landing page that converts
- Your first paying users

12 spots. Starts March 3rd.
