**Lead Magnet:** 3-Hour "Initiation" Taster (RM 250).

## 1. The "Build-in-Public" Loop
- [ ] **Video: The 48-Hour Transformation.** Show a side-by-side of a CEO's messy desktop on Friday vs. their Streamlit Command Center on Sunday. 
- [ ] **Post:** "Why Saturday morning is the most profitable time to learn Python." Focus on the "Weekend Architect" narrative.

## 2. The "Heritage Infiltration"
- [ ] **Architect Cards:** Update copy to highlight "The Weekend Initiation."
- [ ] **Penang Mixer:** Saturday evening drinks for CEOs in George Town (Networking trigger).

## 3. The Taster-to-Weekend Conversion
- [ ] **The "Sensor" Win:** Same 3-hour build (Receipt Sniffer).
- [ ] **The Weekend Gap:** "You built a sensor in 3 hours. On Saturday, we build the Brain. On Sunday, we build the Cockpit. By Monday morning, you are an Architect."
- [ ] **The Multiplyer:** RM 250 → RM 1,000 credit.

## Success Metrics
