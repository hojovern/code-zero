# Proposal: The code:zero AI Strategy Clinic (Exclusive for Hundred Years Residents)

**Concept:** A value-add "Consultancy-as-Content" session for high-tier residents of Hundred Years.
**Goal:** Establish code:zero as the resident AI experts and build a warm lead pipeline for the George Town Academy.

We provide a **complimentary 45-minute "AI Efficiency Audit"** for selected Hundred Years member businesses. 

**What the Resident Gets:**

## 4. The "Founder-to-Founder" Guarantee
This is not a sales presentation. We are builders first. If we can't find a way to save the resident at least 5 hours of work per week, we don't invite them to the Academy.

**Next Step:** 
I suggest we pilot this for the month of February. I can provide the digital assets for your newsletter/Slack channel this week.
