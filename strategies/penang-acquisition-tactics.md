# Penang Acquisition Tactics (The Launch Phase)

## 1. The "Hundred Years" Resident Strategy (Selected Venue)
*   **Status:** INITIATING
*   **The "Resident" Offer:** Provide a 15% "Founding Member" grant to Hundred Years members.
*   **AI Strategy Clinic:** Host a free 45-minute "AI Audit" for their top-tier residents to build trust and launch the funnel.

## 4. The "Silicon Island" Strategy (Tech Manufacturing Execs)
*   **Target:** Directors, Senior Managers, and Technical Leads at MNCs (Agilent, AMD, Intel, Keysight) in Bayan Lepas (FIZ).
*   **Pain Point:** "I manage engineers, but I've stopped building. I'm losing my technical edge to AI."
*   **The Hook:** "Reclaim your technical authority. Build your own Executive Dashboard in one weekend."
*   **Tactics:**
    *   **LinkedIn Geo-Fencing:** Target "Bayan Lepas" + Companies (Intel, etc.) + Seniority (Director/VP).
    *   **The "Lunch Hour" Webinar:** A 30-min "AI for Technical Directors" zoom call during lunch break (1:00 PM - 1:30 PM).

## 5. The "Nomad Multiplier" Strategy
*   **Target:** High-earning Digital Nomads in George Town (Expats/Remote Workers).
*   **Pain Point:** Trading time for money; hitting the "freelancer ceiling."
*   **The Hook:** "Stop selling hours. Start building assets. Turn your service into a software product in 48 hours."
*   **Tactics:**
    *   **FB Group Infiltration:** "Penang Digital Nomads" - meaningful "Show & Tell" posts (e.g., "I built this receipt parser this morning while having coffee at Norm").
    *   **Coworking Partnerships:** While we operate at Hundred Years, we market at Settlements/Common Ground where the nomads sit. Offer a "Guest Pass" to our specific workshops.

## 5. Penang Digital Nomad Infiltration
*   **Channel:** "Penang Digital Nomads" Facebook groups.
*   **The Angle:** "Stop trading time for money. Build a machine."
*   **Event:** Casual "Beer & Build" meetup at a Chulia Street venue.
