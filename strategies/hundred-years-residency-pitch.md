# Pitch: code:zero Weekday Residency (Hundred Years)

**The Request:** 
Dedicated use of one medium meeting room/studio.
**Schedule:** Monday – Friday, 2:00 PM – 6:00 PM (Off-Peak).
**Duration:** 4-week blocks (aligned with Intake cycles).

## Why this is a win for Hundred Years:
1.  **Filling Dead Inventory:** 2 PM – 6 PM is your lowest utilization period for meeting rooms. We turn that empty space into guaranteed monthly revenue.
2.  **The "Aura" Effect:** We are bringing 6-12 high-level builders and executives into the building daily. This adds to the "vibe" of Hundred Years as the epicenter of tech in George Town.
3.  **Ancillary Revenue:** Our students are high-spenders. They will be buying coffee, lunch, and after-work drinks at your associated outlets or neighboring businesses.
4.  **Zero Maintenance:** We don't need setup help. We bring our own projector (Epson) and tech. We leave the room exactly as we found it at 6:00 PM sharp.

## The Proposal:
We propose a flat **Residency Fee** of [RM 3,000 - RM 4,500] per 4-week cycle. 

This is significantly higher than a standard "Private Office" membership but structured to reflect the "Event" nature of our sessions without the prohibitive "Hourly Event" pricing.

## Next Step:
I'd like to walk through the medium rooms tomorrow at 2:00 PM to see which one has the best natural light for our curriculum. Can we sit down for 5 minutes after?
