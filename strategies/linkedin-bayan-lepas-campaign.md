## Ad Variant A: The "Obsolescence" Hook
**Visual:** A split screen. Left side: A sterile corporate meeting room (Boredom). Right side: A dark mode terminal with "Build Successful" green text (Excitement).
**Headline:** You used to build things. Now you just approve budgets.

**Copy:**
Remember the last time you actually shipped code?

If you’re a Technical Director in Bayan Lepas, chances are you spend 90% of your day in meetings and 0% building. Meanwhile, AI is rewriting the rules of the industry you're supposed to be leading.

**Don't let your title outpace your skills.**

Join us for the **CEO AI Command Center**—a 2-day intensive in George Town.
No theory. No PowerPoint. Just you, a terminal, and the new stack (LLMs, RAG, Agents).

**In 48 hours, you will build:**
1. A private RAG engine for your technical documentation.
2. An automated "Meeting Wingman" that briefs you before every call.
3. A "Ghost Negotiator" to scan vendor contracts.

Reclaim your technical authority. Stop managing the future. Build it.

Monday morning at the factory is coming. 
Imagine walking in with a custom AI agent that does your weekly reporting for you.
