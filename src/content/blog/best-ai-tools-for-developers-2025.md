## How to Evaluate New AI Tools

New tools launch constantly. Here's how to evaluate them:

### Questions to Ask

1. **What does it actually do?** Many AI tools have vague pitches. Demand specifics.
2. **How does it integrate?** Does it fit your workflow or require a new one?
3. **What's the learning curve?** Minutes or weeks?
4. **What's the real cost?** Usage-based can get expensive fast.
5. **Who else uses it?** Look for testimonials from similar use cases.

### Red Flags

- No free tier or trial
- Requires major workflow changes
- Vague about what AI does vs. rules
- No documentation or examples
- Founded last month with enterprise pricing

### Green Flags

- Clear, specific use case
- Works with existing tools
- Transparent pricing
- Active community
- Founded by developers who've shipped products

## Staying Current

The AI tools space moves fast. Here's how to keep up without drowning:

### Sources Worth Following

- **Hacker News**: First place new tools appear
- **Twitter/X AI community**: Real-time developments
- **AI-specific newsletters**: The Rundown, TLDR AI
- **GitHub Trending**: What developers actually use

### Learning Strategy

1. **Pick a core stack** and master it before adding tools
2. **Try one new tool per month** in a real project
3. **Drop tools that don't stick** after fair evaluation
4. **Follow the problems, not the tools**—what are you trying to solve?

## Start Building

Tools are only useful if you ship something with them.

Here's the minimum viable AI toolset to start building today:

1. **Claude or ChatGPT** for code help (free tier)
2. **VS Code** for editing (free)
3. **GitHub** for version control (free)
4. **Vercel** for deployment (free tier)
5. **Supabase** for backend (free tier)

That's it. Everything else is optimization.

Open your editor. Start building. Add tools when they solve real problems you encounter.
