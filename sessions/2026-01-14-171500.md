# Current Session: Repository Restructuring

## Goals
- [x] Restructure repository into 3 isolated buckets
- [x] Separate Technical context from Business context
- [x] Preserve git history for all projects

## Actions Taken
- **Consolidated Omni-Brain:** Merged Binky and Website back into a single repo for full-spectrum intelligence.
- **CEO Intensive Defined:** Created 2-Day "Weekend Intensive" curriculum (MCP, n8n, Agents, Dashboards).
- **Stunning UI Mockup:** Codified the "Georgetown Cockpit" dashboard design.
- **Marketing Arsenal:** Built the "Architect Card" specs, LinkedIn pitch, and high-conversion CEO Pitch Script.
- **Venue Intelligence:** Drafted venue requirements and research for George Town heritage shops.

## Current State
- **Repo:** Unified Omni-Brain Repository (Academy + Projects).
- **Product:** CEO AI Command Center (RM 7,800) + Taster (RM 250).
- **Intelligence:** Centralized in root `/.claude/memory/`.

## Open Threads
- Building the Streamlit "Prototype Cockpit" code for live demos.
- Finalizing the Taster Landing Page.
