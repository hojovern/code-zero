## TL;DR
Built CEO AI Command Center course materials, renamed "Ship Sprint" to "Full Stack Web Development", added token efficiency guidelines, merged /learn into /close skill.

## Accomplished
- Created complete CEO AI Command Center course (RM 7,800 premium offering)
  - Full facilitator guide with 5 blocks
  - 4 AI agent skill templates (daily briefing, competitive intel, board prep, email ghostwriter)
  - 4 n8n workflow guides (Zoom→Slack, email triage, news digest, document analyzer)
  - CEO AI Playbook template, quick reference cheatsheet
  - Hands-on exercises for all 4 blocks
- Renamed "Ship Sprint" → "Full Stack Web Development" across all website pages
- Added Token Efficiency section to CLAUDE.md (context loading, avoid redundant reads, concise responses)
- Merged /learn skill into /close - now captures learnings automatically at session end
- Committed and pushed: "feat: Add Week 2 learning portal and CEO AI Command Center course"

## Current State
CEO AI Command Center course is complete with all materials. Website pages updated with new course name. Database still has old name - user needs to click "Seed Database" in /admin to update. Token efficiency guidelines active.

## Open Threads
- [ ] Click "Seed Database" in /admin to update course name in database (sidebar still shows old name)
- [ ] Set up Instagram Business/Meta/Cloudinary for social automation
- [ ] Test CEO AI Command Center materials with pilot client

## Decisions Made
- Stay on Opus everywhere: User doesn't want to risk intelligence for token savings
- Token efficiency via behavior only: Smarter context loading, no model routing
- /close includes /learn: Single command at session end captures everything

## Context for Next Session
- Course rename: URL stays `/ship-sprint` but display name is "Full Stack Web Development"
- Database update pending: Need to run seed to update course record
- Token efficiency: Guidelines added but no model routing (Opus everywhere)
