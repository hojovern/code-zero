# Pricing Decisions

All pricing discussions and their rationale, organized chronologically.

## Consumer Course (Ship Sprint)

### Current: RM 9,800 / 4 weeks
*Set: 2025-01-10*

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Price | RM 9,800/person (~$2,100 USD) |
| Duration | 4 weeks (weekdays, weekends off) |
| Weekly rate | ~$500/week |
| Revenue/cohort (10 pax) | RM 98,000 |
| Revenue/day teaching | RM 4,900 |

**Rationale:**
- Inspired by Marc Lou (CodeFast/ShipFast) model
- 5-10x Marc Lou's digital products - justified by live instruction + cohort + location
- Below "needs spouse approval" threshold for many buyers
- Premium but accessible for target market
- Better unit economics than 6-week model

**Comparison to alternatives:**
| Option | Price | Duration | Weekly Rate |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|
| Marc Lou (digital) | $200-400 | Self-paced | N/A |
| Malaysian bootcamps | RM 11,500-20,000 | 10-16 weeks | RM 1,150-1,250 |
| code:zero | RM 9,800 | 4 weeks | RM 2,450 |
| International bootcamps | $6,500-18,000 | 9-16 weeks | $400-1,125 |

### Previous: RM 13,800 / 6 weeks
*Considered: 2025-01-10, rejected same day*

**Why changed:**
- 6 weeks not credible for "Full Stack" (industry standard 9-16 weeks)
- 4 weeks with "Ship Sprint" positioning is intentionally focused
- Better unit economics (RM 4,900/day vs RM 4,600/day)
- More cohorts possible per year

## Enterprise Course (AI Automation Sprint)

### Current: RM 38,000 / 3 days (per cohort)
*Set: 2025-01-10*

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Price | RM 38,000/cohort (~$8,100 USD) |
| Cohort size | 8-12 people |
| Per-person (at 10 pax) | RM 3,800 |
| Duration | 3 days |
| Daily rate | ~$2,700/day |
| HRDF | Claimable (potentially 100% for SMEs) |

**Rationale:**
- Enterprise day rates typically $1,000-3,500/day - we're competitive at $2,700
- Must be premium enough to signal quality (too cheap = amateur)
- HRDF claimability removes budget objection for Malaysian companies
- 3 days is short enough to get approved without C-level sign-off

**Why not cheaper:**
- Enterprise buyers are suspicious of cheap
- RM 38,000 falls into "strategic investment" budget, not "discretionary"
- Lower price would require more justification, ironically

**Why not longer:**
- Enterprise can't lose teams for more than 3-5 days
- 9 days (original idea) would require C-level approval
- Shorter = easier internal sell

## Pricing Philosophy

### Key Principles (established 2025-01-10)

1. **Price for credibility, not affordability**
   - Too cheap signals amateur, especially for enterprise
   - Premium pricing = taken seriously

2. **Value-based, not cost-based**
   - Consumer: Outcome is shipped product, not hours of instruction
   - Enterprise: Outcome is team capability, not curriculum completion

3. **HRDF is a cheat code**
   - Makes enterprise training "free" for Malaysian SMEs
   - Removes the budget objection entirely

4. **Different buyers, different psychology**
   - Consumer: "Can I afford this?" → Keep under spouse-approval threshold
   - Enterprise: "Is this worth our time?" → Must be substantial enough to matter

## Price Testing Notes

*No tests run yet - pre-launch*

Future considerations:
- Early bird pricing for first cohorts?
- Pilot pricing for case study partners?
- Alumni discounts for repeat students?
