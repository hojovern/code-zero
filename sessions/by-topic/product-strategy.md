Course offerings, positioning, and curriculum decisions.

## Current Product Lineup

### 1. Ship Sprint (Consumer)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Duration | 4 weeks (weekdays, weekends off) |
| Price | RM 9,800/person |
| Cohort size | 8-15 people |
| Format | Hybrid (live afternoons in Penang, online mornings) |
| Target | Entrepreneurs, career changers, developers, international travelers |

**Positioning:**
> "Bought courses but never finished? Ship your product in 4 weeks with 12 builders in Penang."

**What students build:**
- Their own product with AI-powered features
- Email marketing automation
- Data analytics dashboards
- LLM-powered content generation
- n8n workflow automation
- **Shipped, deployed, live by Week 4**

**Key differentiator:** Forcing function for accountability. Not another course to not finish.

**Inspiration:** Marc Lou (CodeFast, ShipFast) - but live cohort instead of self-paced.

### 2. AI Automation Sprint (Enterprise)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Duration | 3 days (9am - 4:30pm) |
| Price | RM 38,000/cohort |
| Cohort size | 8-12 people |
| Format | On-site at client or Penang hub |
| Target | Corporate dev teams, companies with HRDF levy |

**Positioning:**
> "Upskill your dev team on AI automation in 3 days. HRDF claimable. They ship something real by Day 3."

**What teams build:**
- n8n + LLM workflows
- Internal tools with AI
- Automated reporting/analytics
- **Working automation deployed by Day 3**

**Key differentiator:** Short enough to not disrupt, deep enough to matter. HRDF makes it "free."

## Why Two Products

| Need | Consumer Solves | Enterprise Solves |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Individual transformation | ✓ | |
| Team upskilling | | ✓ |
| Deep immersion | ✓ | |
| Minimal disruption | | ✓ |
| Budget flexibility | ✓ (per person) | ✓ (HRDF) |

**Halo effect:** The 6-week consumer program makes the 3-day enterprise course look credible. "They have depth; this is the concentrated version."

---

## Positioning Evolution

### Original Idea
"Full Stack Web Development + AI" (6 weeks, RM 13,800)

**Problems:**
- "Full Stack in 6 weeks" not credible (industry standard 9-16 weeks)
- Competing in bootcamp category = losing comparison
- "Learn to code" positioning attracts wrong students

### Current Positioning
"Ship Sprint" (4 weeks, RM 9,800)

**Why it works:**
- "Ship" is the outcome, not "learn"
- 4 weeks is intentionally focused, not insufficiently short
- Competes with entrepreneur programs, not bootcamps
- "Forcing function" for people who buy courses but don't finish

---

## What We're NOT

Established 2025-01-10:

- NOT a traditional bootcamp (we're a build sprint)
- NOT theory-heavy (you build from day one)
- NOT training people to be corporate code monkeys
- NOT taught by academics reading slides
- NOT another course you won't finish
- NOT about getting a job at a big company

---

## Curriculum Decisions

### Still TBD
- Specific tech stack (SvelteKit? Next.js?)
- Which AI tools specifically
- Day-by-day syllabus

### Decided
- n8n for automation workflows
- LLM integration (OpenAI, etc.)
- "Ship something real" as the guiding principle
- 50% hands-on minimum (especially for enterprise)

---

## Future Product Ideas

*Not yet planned, just noted:*

- Alumni community / ongoing access
- Advanced sprint (for Ship Sprint graduates)
- Industry-specific enterprise versions (FinTech, etc.)
- Online-only cohort (for international students who can't travel)
