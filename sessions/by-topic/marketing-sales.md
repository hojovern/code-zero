## Enterprise Sales

| Taster session outline | `/enterprise/taster-session-outline.md` | Free 1-hour workshop playbook |

### Sales Process

```
LinkedIn outreach → Free taster (1 hr) → Proposal → Pilot cohort → Case study → Repeat
```

### HRDF Strategy

**Critical for Malaysian enterprise sales:**
- Must register as HRDF training provider
- Makes training "free" for SMEs (100% claimable)
- Removes budget objection
- Process: Apply at hrdcorp.gov.my (2-4 weeks)

### Handling "No Case Studies" Objection

Script from taster session outline:
> "We're launching this program in Q1 2025. You'd be among our first cohorts—which means more customization, direct access to our founders, and we're offering pilot pricing for companies willing to share feedback."

Turn early-stage into advantage: customization, access, pilot pricing.

## Messaging Don'ts

Established 2025-01-10:

- Don't call it a "bootcamp" (invites wrong comparison)
- Don't say "Full Stack" for short programs (not credible)
- Don't use "revolutionary" or "game-changing" (hype words)
- Don't say "learn to code" (too generic)
- Don't price too low for enterprise (signals amateur)
