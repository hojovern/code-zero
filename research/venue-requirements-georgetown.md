# code:zero Georgetown Lab: Venue Requirements

**Objective:** Secure a space that justifies a RM 14,800 price point and facilitates the "Command Table" mastermind layout.

---

## 1. The "Command Room" (Primary Space)
- **Dimensions:** Minimum 400 sq ft for the main lab. Must fit a single table for 8-10 people with generous "Chair-Back" space.
- **The Table:** Space for a single "Mastermind" table (e.g., 3.5m x 1.2m). Avoid individual desks.
- **The "Hero" Wall:** One solid, unobstructed wall for a 75-inch+ display or high-end laser projection.
- **Heritage Features:** Exposed brick, timber beams, or high ceilings. These are "Trust Signals" for the premium price point.

## 2. Technical Infrastructure (Non-Negotiable)
- **Connectivity:** Must support TIME or Maxis Fiber. 
    - *Test:* Run a speed test during scouting. Need < 20ms ping to major AI endpoints.
- **Electrical:** Minimum 3 dedicated circuits for the main table to avoid tripping breakers when 8 MacBooks and the display are under load.
- **Acoustics:** Heritage buildings can be "echoey." Look for spaces where you can add soft furnishings or rugs without ruining the vibe. High noise from Chulia St is a "Fail."

## 3. The "White Glove" Arrival (UX)
- **Entrance:** Level 2 access must feel "Exclusive," not "Sketchy." The staircase should be well-lit and clean.
- **The "Transition" Zone:** A small area at the entrance for a "Check-in Tablet" and coffee station. 
- **Restrooms:** Must be private and high-standard. CEOs will judge the entire course by the quality of the restroom.

## 4. Operational Comfort
- **Cooling:** Capacity for 2.5HP+ Inverter AC units. Must be able to reach 22°C within 15 mins of start.
- **Natural Light:** Windows facing the street are a plus for "Vibe," but must have high-quality blackout blinds for the "Screen Sessions."

## Proximity "API"
- **Coffee:** Must be within a 3-min walk of a top-tier café (e.g., narrow marquee, MoonTree, or Ome by Spacebar).
- **Parking:** Identify the nearest "easy" parking for busy executives who won't want to circle Chulia St for 20 mins.
