# Penang Scouting Sprint: George Town Lab

**Objective:** Secure a Level 2 Heritage Shop (First Floor) on Malay St or Muntri St for code:zero Academy. Target Rent: RM 5,000.

## 1. Street Pulse & Neighborhood
- [ ] **Muntri Street:** High-end, "Exclusive Club" vibe. Check for Level 2 spaces above boutique hotels or cafés.
- [ ] **Malay Street:** The "Gritty Builder" choice. Lower rent, potentially more flexible landlords.
- [ ] **Lebuh Chulia:** high visibility, high noise. Look for hidden alleyway entrances leading to quiet upper floors.

## 2. Technical Constraints (The "No-Go" Killers)
- [ ] **Fiber Audit:** Must have access to TIME or Maxis Fiber (1Gbps recommended). Ask neighbors for speed tests.
- [ ] **Power Load:** Check the breaker box. Can it handle 12+ high-powered laptops + 2-3 AC units simultaneously?
- [ ] **Remote Access:** Can a CEO find the place easily, or is the entrance too "Ghostly"?

## 3. The "First Floor" (Level 2) Checklist
- [ ] **Staircase Width:** Can 12 desks/chairs be carried up without damaging heritage walls?
- [ ] **Ceiling Height:** High ceilings are standard in heritage buildings—great for air circulation, but check for AC efficiency.
- [ ] **Zoning:** Is it "Commercial" or "Residential"? (Must be Commercial).

## 4. Taster Session Venues (Short-term Rent)
*Scout these for the RM 250 validation sessions:*
- [ ] **narrow marquee (Malay St):** Upstairs event space.
- [ ] **MoonTree 47 (Muntri St):** Good vibe, central.
- [ ] **Common Ground / Settlements:** Back-up options if heritage spaces lack fiber.

## 5. Intelligence Capture
- [ ] Take photos of every potential entrance.
- [ ] Record a 60-second voice note about the "vibe" of each street (Binky Sniffer pattern).
- [ ] Ask 3 local shop owners: "Who is the landlord here, and are they difficult?"
