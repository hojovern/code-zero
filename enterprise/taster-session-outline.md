# Enterprise Taster Session

## Purpose

1. Show competence (they see you teach)
2. Deliver real value (they leave with something useful)
3. Create desire (they want more)
4. Soft pitch (natural transition to full program)

## Agenda

### 0:00 - 0:03 | Opening (3 min)

- Introduce yourself (30 seconds—credibility, not life story)
- "In the next hour, you'll build an AI automation you can use tomorrow"
- No lengthy preamble—get to value fast

### 0:03 - 0:08 | The Landscape (5 min)

**"What's possible now" — QUICK**

Flash 3 examples (30 seconds each, don't dwell):
- Slack bot answering questions from company docs
- n8n workflow that summarizes daily emails
- Auto-generated reports from data

Key message: "Teams are shipping these now. Let me show you how."

### 0:08 - 0:40 | Live Demo: Build Something Real (32 min)

**This is the core. Show, don't tell.**

**DEFAULT DEMO: n8n + OpenAI workflow (pre-built, modify live)**

Have a working workflow ready. Don't build from scratch—modify and explain.

| Step | Time | What You Do |
|------|------|-------------|
| Show the finished workflow | 2 min | "Here's what we're building" |
| Break it down | 5 min | Explain each node: trigger → LLM → output |
| Modify it live | 10 min | Change the prompt, add a step, show flexibility |
| Run it | 3 min | Trigger it, show the output in Slack/email |
| Explain the patterns | 7 min | "This same pattern works for X, Y, Z..." |
| Mini hands-on (optional) | 5 min | Let them try changing the prompt |

**Demo flow:**
1. Trigger: Webhook or form submission
2. Action: OpenAI summarizes/categorizes input
3. Output: Posts to Slack channel or sends email

**Why this demo:**
- Visual (n8n is drag-and-drop, non-threatening)
- Impressive output (AI doing real work)
- Low failure risk (pre-built, just modifying)
- Applicable (everyone has forms/emails to process)

**BACKUP: Pre-recorded video**
If wifi/API fails, have a 5-minute video of the same demo ready. Say: "Let me show you a recording so we don't waste time on technical issues."

### 0:40 - 0:50 | Q&A (10 min)

Let them ask questions. This reveals:
- Their specific pain points
- Their current skill level
- Who's most interested (potential champion)

Good questions to prompt if needed:
- "What repetitive tasks does your team do that could be automated?"
- "Where are you currently using AI tools?"
- "What's stopped you from building more with AI?"

### 0:50 - 0:55 | The Full Program (5 min)

**Soft pitch—brief, not salesy**

"What we just did is the first hour of Day 1. Here's the full 3 days..."

One slide:
- Day 1: Fundamentals + first automation
- Day 2: Advanced workflows + integrations
- Day 3: Apply to your business problem

Two key points:
- "HRDF claimable—potentially zero cost for SMEs"
- "8-12 people per cohort, hands-on the entire time"

"If this is interesting, I'll send a proposal this week. No pressure."

### 0:55 - 1:00 | Close (5 min)

- "Thanks for your time"
- Hand out: Your 1-pager PDF (leave behind)
- "I'll follow up with [manager name] this week to see if there's interest"
- Exchange contacts

## Materials Needed

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Laptop with n8n / demo environment ready | Live demo |
| Backup video of demo | In case wifi/tech fails |
| 1-pager PDFs (printed) | Leave behind |
| Business cards | Contact exchange |
| Slide deck (minimal, 5-7 slides max) | Structure, not content |

---

## Slide Deck Structure

1. **Title**: AI Automation in 60 Minutes
2. **About me**: 1 slide, 3 bullets, done
3. **The landscape**: What's possible now (examples)
4. **Live demo**: Screen share, no slides
5. **What we covered**: Recap
6. **The full program**: 3-day overview
7. **Next steps**: Contact info, HRDF note

## Common Questions (Be Ready)

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| "What if our team isn't technical enough?" | "If they can write basic code, they can do this. Day 1 starts from fundamentals." |
| "Can you customize for our industry?" | "Yes—Day 3 is specifically about applying to your business problems." |
| "What's the cost?" | "RM 38,000 per cohort of 8-12. HRDF claimable, so potentially zero out-of-pocket for SMEs." |
| "How is this different from online courses?" | "They'll ship something real in 3 days, with hands-on guidance. Not watch videos for 3 months." |
| "Can we do this virtually?" | "Yes, though in-person is better for hands-on work. We can discuss what works for your team." |
| "Who else have you trained?" | "We're launching this program in Q1 2025. You'd be among our first cohorts—which means more customization, direct access to our founders, and we're offering pilot pricing for companies willing to share feedback." |
| "Why should we trust you without case studies?" | "Fair question. That's why we offer the free taster—you've seen how we teach. We're also offering a pilot rate with a satisfaction guarantee for early partners." |

## Success Metrics

After the taster, you should have:

- [ ] Contact info for the decision maker
- [ ] Understanding of their pain points
- [ ] Verbal interest ("send us a proposal")
- [ ] At least one potential champion identified
- [ ] Champion's direct email (not just the group list)
- [ ] Left behind the 1-pager

---

## Follow-Up Sequence

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Day 0 | Send thank you email + 1-pager PDF (within 2 hours) |
| Day 1 | Send proposal if they expressed interest |
| Day 3 | Follow-up call with decision maker |
| Day 7 | Final nudge or schedule next touchpoint |
| Day 14 | If no response, move to nurture (monthly check-in) |

**Speed matters.** Enterprise momentum dies fast. Don't wait.

## Pro Tips

1. **Start on time, end early** - Respect is earned by respecting their time
2. **Don't oversell** - The demo sells itself. Be helpful, not pushy.
3. **Name drop carefully** - If you've trained other companies, mention it
4. **Find the champion** - One person will be most engaged. Get their contact.
5. **Have backup plan** - If demo fails, have a video recording ready
6. **Read the room** - If they're loving it, extend Q&A. If restless, speed up.

---

## What NOT To Do

- Don't spend 20 minutes on your background
- Don't use jargon they don't know
- Don't make the demo too complex (simple + working > ambitious + broken)
- Don't trash competitors
- Don't pressure for commitment on the spot
- Don't leave without next steps agreed

---

*Goal: They leave thinking "that was actually useful" and "I want my team to learn this"*
