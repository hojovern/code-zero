## About code:zero

code:zero is a tech training company based in Penang, Malaysia. We train development teams to build and ship AI-powered products using battle-tested workflows from real companies.

Founded by engineers and entrepreneurs who've built products across web development, AI automation, and product design.

## The Problem

Your developers are Googling "how to use ChatGPT for coding" between meetings. Meanwhile, competitors are shipping AI-powered features weekly.

The gap isn't talent—it's training.

| What They'll Build |
|--------------------|
| LLM-powered internal tools |
| Automated workflows with n8n |
| AI-assisted analytics dashboards |
| Email/content automation pipelines |

**Not theory. Not slides. Real systems they ship by Day 3.**
