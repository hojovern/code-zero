## Part 1: The Identity Shift (0:00 - 0:30)
- **The Hook:** Show the code:zero Omni-Brain repo.
- **The Narrative:** "Software is an opinion. Today, you stop renting other people's opinions and start coding your own."
- **The Setup:** Open the `taster-lab-kit` in VS Code.

## Part 2: The Command Sprint (0:30 - 1:30)
- **The Action:** Command the Terminal AI to read the `/receipts` folder using the provided `CodeZeroEngine`.
- **The teaching:** Focus on **Intent** over **Syntax**.
- **The "Magic" Moment:** First successful data extraction from a messy Starbucks receipt.

## Part 3: The System Gap (1:30 - 2:15)
- **The Wall:** Try to add a feature the script can't handle (e.g., "Compare this to my bank balance").

## Part 4: The Handover & Close (2:15 - 3:00)
- **The Ownership:** Show them how to run the script they built without help.

## Instructor Rules
1. **Never touch the plumbing:** If a dependency fails, swap the laptop for a spare. Do not debug `pip` in front of a CEO.
2. **Focus on Business Logic:** Always tie code decisions back to profit, time, or leverage.
3. **The 10-Minute Rule:** If they aren't seeing data on their screen within 10 minutes of Part 2, the "Magic" is dead.
