## Week 3 Mindset

**"If it doesn't make money, it's a hobby."**

Lots of people build products. Few build businesses. The difference:
- Products are cool
- Businesses generate revenue
- Products have users
- Businesses have customers

Week 3 you cross the line from builder to founder.

## The Business Stack

By end of Week 3, you have infrastructure:

```
Your Business
├── Revenue layer       → Stripe payments
├── Analytics layer     → User behavior data
├── SEO layer          → Organic discovery
├── Quality layer      → Tests + monitoring
└── Launch layer       → Beta users + feedback
```

This isn't just a product anymore. It's a business with revenue, data, and customers.
