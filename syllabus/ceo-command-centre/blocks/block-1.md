# Block 1: Build Your Command Center

Welcome to the cockpit, Commander. 🕹️ Before we build agents, we need to give your AI a **Soul**.

## Learn

Most people use AI as a generic calculator. A CEO uses it as a **Partner**. To do that, your AI needs to know who you are, what your business does, and how you like to work.

We do this using a **Command Layer**—a set of persistent instructions that act as your AI's "long-term memory." We'll be creating your `CLAUDE.md` file. This isn't just a document; it's a **Context Engine** that ensures your AI never asks "What do you do again?" ever again. 🧠

### Code Example (Your Context DNA)

Copy this structure into your memory layer:

```markdown
# MISSION CONTROL
Role: CEO of [Company Name]
Focus: [Primary Goal for 2026]

## BUSINESS DNA
Product: [What you sell]
Customer: [Who you serve]

## VOICE FINGERPRINT
Tone: [Professional / Direct / Whimsical]
Banned Words: [Synergy, Leverage, Deep-dive]
```

## Exercise

Your first quest is to define your **Business DNA**.

### Instructions

1. Identify your **Top 3 Priorities** for the next quarter.
2. Define your **Voice Fingerprint** (how you want your agents to sound).
3. Save these into your `CLAUDE.md` file and watch your AI instantly become "Business Capable."
