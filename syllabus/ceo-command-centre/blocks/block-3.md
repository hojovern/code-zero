# Block 3: Automation Power

Welcome to Day 2. ⚡ Today, we connect the dots. Intelligence without automation is just "more reading."

## Learn

Automation is the **Connective Tissue** of your Command Centre. We use **Workflows** to move data between your meetings, your email, and your AI agents.

Think of a workflow as a "Train Track."
*   **Trigger:** Meeting ends on Zoom.
*   **Action:** Audio is sent to AI for transcription.
*   **Outcome:** Summary is posted to Slack + Action items added to your Dashboard.

We'll be using **n8n**—the CEO's favorite automation tool because it's visual, powerful, and lives on your own infrastructure. 🏗️

### Workflow Logic

```
[Trigger: New Email] -> [Filter: VIP List] -> [AI: Draft Response] -> [Notify: Slack]
```

## Exercise

Build your **Daily Briefing Pipeline**.

### Instructions

1. Connect your **Calendar** to the automation hub.
2. Set a trigger for **7:00 AM**.
3. Direct the AI to summarize today's schedule and send it to your phone.
