# Block 2: Deploy Your Agent Fleet

It's time to build your Staff. 👥 We’re deploying 4 specialists that work for you 24/7.

## Learn

An **Agent** is an AI with a specific job, a specific toolset, and a specific schedule. Unlike a chat window, an agent **acts**.

Today, we are deploying your "Core Four":
1. **The Ghostwriter**: Drafts emails in your voice.
2. **The Intel Scout**: Monitors competitors and surfaces news.
3. **The Boardroom Prep**: Turns messy notes into structured outlines.
4. **The Daily Briefer**: Your 7 AM executive summary.

We use **Persona Logic** to ensure each agent stays in their lane. 🚀

### Code Example (Ghostwriter Persona)

```yaml
Name: Ghostwriter
Task: Email Drafting
Constraint: 
  - Keep it under 3 sentences.
  - End with a clear Call to Action.
  - Use the CEO's specific sign-off.
```

## Exercise

Deploy your first scout.

### Instructions

1. Pick one competitor you want to monitor.
2. Define the **Scout Persona** instructions.
3. Link the scout to your News Feed and trigger the first "Intel Report."
