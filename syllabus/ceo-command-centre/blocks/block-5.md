# Block 5: Map to Your Business

The tools are ready. Now, we apply them to your **Highest Value Problems**. 🎯

## Learn

Not all AI opportunities are equal. A CEO's job is to identify the **High-Leverage** tasks—the ones that take 10 hours but could take 10 seconds.

We use the **Leverage Matrix**:
*   **Low Complexity / High Impact:** Automate these first (e.g., meeting summaries).
*   **High Complexity / High Impact:** These are your "Strategic Agents."
*   **Low Impact:** Ignore them.

Today, we're mapping your specific business bottlenecks to AI solutions. 🗺️

## Exercise

### Instructions
