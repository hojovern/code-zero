## What to Tell Your Team Monday

### The 30-Second Version

> "I spent a day building an AI system. Not playing with ChatGPT — actually building infrastructure. I now have AI agents that work while I sleep. One briefs me every morning, one monitors competitors, one drafts my emails in my voice. I also automated meeting summaries and document analysis. This is what I want us to explore for the whole company."

### Questions to Ask Your Team

**Ask your CTO:**
- "What would it take to roll this out company-wide?"
- "How do we handle data security for AI workflows?"

**Ask your COO:**
- "Which operations processes could benefit from AI automation?"
- "What are our highest-volume, repetitive workflows?"

**Ask your CFO:**
- "What reporting could we automate?"
- "What financial analysis takes the most time?"

**Ask your CMO:**
- "Could AI help with content creation and competitive monitoring?"
- "What marketing tasks are most repetitive?"

### The Team Training Conversation

> "I'd like to bring the leadership team through a similar training. Each person would build AI agents specific to their role. [Contact JV] has a team package. Can you coordinate schedules?"
