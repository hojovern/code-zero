---

## Section 7: Risks & Challenges

**Headline:** Eyes open on three risks

**3 Key Points:**
1. Macro uncertainty affecting enterprise sales cycles
2. Key competitor raised $50M (Acme - expect aggressive pricing)
3. Engineering velocity slower than planned (addressed with new hire)

**Suggested Visual:** Risk matrix with mitigation status

**Likely Question:** "How worried should we be about Acme?"

**Prepared Answer:** "Watchful but not worried. Their enterprise motion is 12 months behind. We're winning head-to-head."

## Section 8: Ask/Discussion

**Headline:** Need alignment on one strategic question

---

## Appendix Recommendations

Have ready but don't present unless asked:
- Detailed financial model
- Customer logo list by segment
- Competitive feature comparison
- Full product roadmap
- Team compensation benchmarks

---

## Your Narrative Arc

**Opening:** "Q4 was a proof point quarter. We proved we can grow profitably in a tough market. Today I'll share the results and where we're going next."

**Key Thread:** The story is profitable growth + AI differentiation + team execution. Every slide connects to at least one of these.

**Closing:** "We're asking for alignment on the BigCorp partnership today. With that resolved, we're set up for a strong 2025."

---

## Red Flags to Get Ahead Of

1. **Sales pipeline concentration** - 40% is one deal. Acknowledge it.
2. **Engineering delays** - Be transparent about the challenge and fix.
3. **Cash position** - Board will ask about runway even though 18 months is healthy.

## Tips for Best Results

- **Dump everything** - don't pre-organize, let AI find the structure
- **Include the messy stuff** - concerns, risks, problems. Better to surface them.
- **Run it early** - gives you time to refine before crunch time
- **Save the output** - becomes input for next quarter
