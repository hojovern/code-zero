# code:zero Full Stack Web Development

> 4 weeks. 12 builders. 1 shipped product.

## Philosophy

**Ship > Learn.** Every lesson produces something real. No theory without application. No "we'll use this later." If it doesn't ship, it doesn't stay.

**AI-First Development.** Claude Code isn't a tool you use sometimes—it's how you build. Day 1, you set up your AI workspace. Day 20, AI agents are running your content engine while you demo to investors.

**Your Product, Not Ours.** You're not building a tutorial clone. You're building YOUR idea. We provide the stack, the structure, and the pressure. You provide the vision.
