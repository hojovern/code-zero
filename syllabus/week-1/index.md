# Week 1: AI-First Foundation

> "Build the system that builds the product."

## Week Objective

By Friday, you have:
1. An AI workspace that knows YOUR project
2. Reusable skills that do work FOR you
3. A live product with users and AI features
4. A demo you're proud to present

This isn't "learn to code." This is "learn to build with AI."

## By End of Week

- [ ] CLAUDE.md that captures your project
- [ ] Blog writer skill (reusable forever)
- [ ] Live URL anyone can visit
- [ ] User authentication + database
- [ ] Core product feature (CRUD)
- [ ] AI-powered feature for users
- [ ] Content engine that generates blog + social + email
- [ ] 2-minute demo of your content machine

## The Difference

**Traditional bootcamp Week 1:**
- Setup environments
- Learn syntax
- Build tutorial projects
- Ship: nothing real

**Ship Sprint Week 1:**
- Set up AI workspace
- Build WITH AI, not alone
- Ship YOUR product, not tutorials
- Ship: live product + content + users

## Day-by-Day

### [Day 1: AI Workspace → Live Website](day-1.md)
Set up Claude Code + CLAUDE.md + your first skill (blog writer). Then use that workspace to build your landing page and deploy. All in one day.

**You ship:** AI workspace + blog skill + live website + first blog post

### [Day 2: Users Are Real](day-2.md)
Add Supabase auth and database. Users can create accounts on YOUR app. Store their first piece of data.

**You ship:** Working authentication + database + user profiles

### [Day 3: Build the Thing](day-3.md)
Your product's core feature. Whatever makes your idea unique—we build it today. AI-assisted the whole way.

**You ship:** The main feature that makes your product useful

### [Day 4: AI Does the Work](day-4.md)
Add AI to your product. Free tier APIs (Gemini/ChatGPT). Your app gets intelligent. AI solves a real problem for users.

**You ship:** AI-powered feature that delivers real value

### [Day 5: Your AI Content Engine](day-5.md)
Build the capstone: an AI system that generates blog posts, social snippets, and email drafts—all in your voice. Then demo it live to the intake.

**You ship:** Working content engine + 2-minute demo

## Week 1 Mindset

**"AI-first, not AI-added."**

Most people use AI like Google: ask a question, get an answer, go back to working alone.

That's backwards. AI should be:
- In your workflow (Claude Code in terminal)
- Knowing your context (CLAUDE.md)
- Following your processes (Skills)
- Doing actual work (not just answering questions)

Week 1 teaches this mindset. By Friday, AI isn't a tool you use sometimes—it's how you build.

## The Real Skill

By end of Week 1, you won't just have a product. You'll have a **system**:

```
Your Workspace
├── CLAUDE.md              → AI knows your project
├── .claude/skills/        → AI follows your workflows
│   ├── blog-writer/       → Content generation
│   ├── auth-setup/        → Authentication patterns
│   └── content-engine/    → Multi-format AI pipeline
├── content/               → AI-generated content
└── src/                   → AI-assisted code
    └── routes/content/    → Your content machine
```

This system scales. Week 2-4, you're not starting over—you're building on a foundation where AI already knows everything about your project. And your content engine keeps producing while you sleep.

*By Friday, you'll have shipped more than most people ship in months. You'll have a product, users, and a content machine. All built WITH AI.*
