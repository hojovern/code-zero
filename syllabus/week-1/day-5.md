# Day 5: Your AI Content Engine

> "Leave Week 1 with a machine that creates for you."

## The Challenge

**By end of day, you have an AI system that generates content for YOUR product.**

Not one blog post. A SYSTEM. Blog posts, social snippets, email drafts—all generated by AI, all in your voice, all for your audience.

This is the capstone. Everything you learned this week comes together.

---

## What You're Building

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|--------------|
| Content Generator | AI creates blog posts in your voice |
| Social Snippets | AI extracts shareable quotes |
| Email Draft | AI writes newsletter from your content |
| Content Dashboard | See and manage all generated content |

**By 4pm:** You demo a working content engine to the cohort.

## Morning: Build the Engine

### 1. Architecture Planning (30 min)

**Tell Claude your vision:**
```
You: I want to build an AI content engine for [my product].

It should:
1. Generate blog posts about topics in my niche
2. Create social media snippets from each post
3. Draft email newsletters
4. Store everything in my database
5. Let me review and edit before publishing

Help me plan the architecture. What tables do I need?
What AI functions? What UI components?
```

Claude will map out:
- Database schema for content storage
- AI functions needed
- UI components to build
- How everything connects

**Your content system structure:**
```
Content Engine
├── content table (stores all generated content)
├── AI functions
│   ├── generateBlogPost(topic)
│   ├── generateSocialSnippets(blogPost)
│   └── generateEmailDraft(blogPost)
└── Dashboard UI
    ├── Topic input
    ├── Generated content list
    └── Edit/publish controls
```

### 2. Build Content Generator (60 min)

**Create the database table:**
```
You: Create a content table in Supabase for my content engine.

Store:
- id, user_id, created_at (standard)
- topic: what the content is about
- blog_post: the full generated blog post (markdown)
- social_snippets: array of 3-5 tweetable quotes
- email_draft: newsletter version
- status: draft, reviewed, published

Include RLS so users only see their own content.
```

**Build the blog generator:**
```
You: Create a generateBlogPost function that:

1. Takes a topic as input
2. Reads CLAUDE.md for brand voice and audience info
3. Calls Gemini with a prompt that generates:
   - Attention-grabbing headline
   - Hook that identifies the problem
   - 3 main sections with actionable advice
   - Call-to-action relevant to [my product]
4. Returns markdown-formatted blog post
5. Targets 800-1200 words

The prompt should make the AI write like our brand—[describe your tone].
Use my blog-writer skill as reference for the structure.
```

**Test it:**
```
You: Add a test endpoint at /api/test-content that generates
a blog post about "[topic in your niche]" and returns it.
```

Check the output. Is it in your voice? Does it sound like your brand?

**Iterate on the prompt:**
```
You: The output is too [generic/formal/casual].
Adjust the prompt to [specific change].
Also make sure it mentions [your product] naturally, not forced.
```

### 3. Add Social + Email (75 min)

**Build social snippet generator:**
```
You: Create a generateSocialSnippets function that:

1. Takes a blog post as input
2. Extracts 5 shareable quotes/insights
3. Each snippet should be:
   - Under 280 characters (tweet-length)
   - Standalone (makes sense without context)
   - Intriguing (makes people want to read more)
4. Returns an array of 5 snippets

Format each with relevant emoji and hashtag suggestions.
```

**Build email draft generator:**
```
You: Create a generateEmailDraft function that:

1. Takes a blog post as input
2. Creates a newsletter version that:
   - Has a compelling subject line
   - Opens with a personal hook
   - Summarizes the key insights (not the full post)
   - Includes a "Read the full post" CTA
   - Ends with a P.S. that teases next week
3. Targets 200-300 words (email-appropriate length)

Make it feel personal, like I'm writing to a friend who's interested in [your niche].
```

**Create the full pipeline:**
```
You: Create a generateAllContent function that:

1. Takes a topic
2. Generates the blog post
3. Generates social snippets from the blog post
4. Generates email draft from the blog post
5. Saves everything to the content table
6. Returns the complete content object

Add proper error handling—if one step fails, save what we have
and mark which parts failed.
```

---

## Afternoon: Dashboard + Demo

### 4. Content Dashboard (60 min)

**Build the UI:**
```
You: Create a /content page for managing my content engine.

Include:
1. Topic input form
   - Text field for topic
   - "Generate Content" button
   - Loading state that shows progress ("Generating blog post...", "Creating snippets...", etc.)

2. Content list
   - Show all generated content
   - Display topic, status, created date
   - Click to expand and see full content

3. Content detail view
   - Show blog post (rendered markdown)
   - Show social snippets (each in a card, with copy button)
   - Show email draft
   - Edit capability for each section
   - "Mark as Reviewed" and "Publish" buttons

Match our brand styling. Make it feel like a real content management tool.
```

**Add the generate flow:**
```
You: When user submits a topic:

1. Show a progress modal with steps:
   - "Generating blog post..." (spinner)
   - "Creating social snippets..."
   - "Drafting email..."
   - "Saving to database..."
2. Each step shows checkmark when complete
3. On success, close modal and show the new content
4. On error, show which step failed and allow retry

Make it feel satisfying to watch the AI work.
```

### 5. Polish + Edge Cases (30 min)

**Handle edge cases:**
```
You: Add these improvements to the content engine:

1. Prevent duplicate topics (warn if similar topic exists)
2. Add "Regenerate" button for each content piece
3. Add character count to social snippets
4. Add "Copy to clipboard" for email draft
5. Show word count on blog post
6. Add delete content functionality

Also add empty state when no content exists yet.
```

**Final test:**
- Generate content for 2-3 different topics
- Verify all pieces are created
- Test edit and save
- Test on mobile
- Check that RLS works (other users can't see your content)

| Output | 30 sec | Show blog + snippets + email. "All from one click." |
| Close | 15 sec | "Week 1: AI workspace to content engine." |

### Demo Script Template

```
HOOK (15 seconds):
"Creating content for [my product] used to take hours.
Now I type a topic and get a blog post, 5 social posts, and an email. Watch."

GENERATE (60 seconds):
[Type topic, click Generate]
"The AI is writing a full blog post in my brand voice..."
[Show progress]
"Now it's extracting shareable quotes..."
"And drafting a newsletter..."
[Content appears]

OUTPUT (30 seconds):
"Here's an 1000-word blog post, ready to publish."
[Scroll through it]
"5 tweets I can post right now."
[Show snippets]
"And an email draft for my newsletter."

CLOSE (15 seconds):
"5 days ago I had an idea. Now I have a product with users,
AI features, and a content machine. That's code:zero."
```

### Demo Day Rules

1. **2 minutes MAX.** Timer cuts you off.
2. **Live generation.** Show the AI working in real-time.
3. **Real output.** Show actual generated content.
4. **Your URL.** Demo from your deployed site.
5. **Have backup.** Pre-generated content if live fails.

### Presenting Order

Random order. When your name is called:
1. Share screen
2. State your name and product
3. Start timer
4. Demo
5. Stop when time's up

### Giving Feedback

For each demo, note:
1. **One thing that impressed you**
2. **One suggestion for improvement**

Be specific. "The AI output looked professional" → "The way it matched your brand voice in the email was impressive."

## The Content Engine Pattern

What you built today is reusable:

```
.claude/
└── skills/
    └── content-engine/
        ├── SKILL.md
        └── templates/
            ├── content-table.sql
            ├── generate-functions.ts
            └── content-dashboard.svelte
```

**Tell Claude:**
```
You: Create a content-engine skill from what we built today.
Document the full system so I can add this to any future project.
```

Now you have a content machine pattern for every product you build.

## Homework (Optional)

This weekend, if you want:

1. **Generate 5 pieces of content** — Build up your content library
2. **Actually publish one** — Post a blog, send an email, tweet the snippets
3. **Share your URL** — Get someone else to try your product
4. **Refine the prompts** — Make the AI output even more "you"
