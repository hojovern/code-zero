# The Setup Quest

> Welcome to your first mission, Commander! Today, we’re setting up the cockpit of your CEO Command Centre. 🚀

## Learn

To build an automated empire, you need the right tools in your belt. A **CEO Command Centre** isn't just a website; it's a centralized hub that talks to databases, AI models, and local files. 🛠️

First, we need the **Terminal**. This is where you'll give direct orders to your computer. We'll also be using **Node.js**, the engine that will run our automation scripts, and the **Supabase CLI**, which handles our database "Brain" in the cloud. ⚡

Think of this as assembling your first piece of high-tech gear. Once these are installed, you’ll be able to "Gizmosis" any website instantly! 🧪

### Code Example

Open your terminal and check if you have the core engines ready:

```bash
# Check Node version
node -v

# Check if Supabase CLI is ready
supabase --version
```

**Output:**
```
v20.10.0
2.1.1
```

## Exercise

Your task is to verify your environment and initialize your first project directory. This is where your Command Centre will live!

### Instructions

1. Open your **Terminal** (or iTerm2).
2. Create a new folder named `command-centre` using the `mkdir` command.
3. Move into that folder and check your **Node.js** version to ensure you're ready for takeoff.
