## Week 2 Mindset

**"Automate yourself out of the loop."**

Most founders are bottlenecks. Everything waits for them:
- "I need to send that email"
- "I need to create that content"
- "I need to check that data"

Week 2 teaches you to build systems that don't need you. By Friday, your product is doing work at 3am while you sleep.

---

## The Real Skill

By end of Week 2, you don't just have features. You have **infrastructure**:

```
Your Product
├── Real-time layer      → Instant updates everywhere
├── Storage layer        → Files and media handled
├── Automation layer     → n8n workflows running
└── AI layer            → Agents working on autopilot
    ├── Content Agent    → Generates weekly content
    ├── Welcome Agent    → Personalizes onboarding
    └── Report Agent     → Summarizes activity
```

This is what separates side projects from real products. The product works FOR you, not the other way around.

*By Friday, you'll watch your AI agents working while you demo. That's the moment it clicks—you're not just building, you're orchestrating.*
