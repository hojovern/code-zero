- **Cohort Cycle**: 4 weeks instruction + 2 weeks prep/gap.
- **FS Intake**: 6 students per cohort @ RM 14,800.
- **CEO AI Command**: 1 session per cohort @ RM 7,800.
- **Monthly Fixed Burn**: RM 22,000 (Facility + Team + Marketing + Tech).
- **Cohort Variable Cost**: RM 10,000 (Instructors + Catering + Kits).
