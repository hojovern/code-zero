# code:zero Mentor Partner Compensation Model

**Philosophy:** We do not offer equity (shares). We offer "Phantom Equity" via Profit Sharing. Everyone eats from the same harvest.

## The Financial Definition
**Intake Gross Profit (IGP)** = Total Ticket Revenue - Direct Intake Costs.
*   *Revenue:* Ticket sales, Upsells.
*   *Direct Costs:* Venue Rental, Ad Spend specific to intake, Food/Bev, Materials, Cloud Costs (GPU/API).
*   *Excluded:* Founder's personal salary, fixed annual overheads, company secretary fees.

## 4. Future Expansion & Guest Mentors
**The "Reserve" Pool (5% Remainder)**
Currently, the Senior (10%) and Junior (5%) utilize 15% of the allocated 20% Mentor Pool. The remaining **5%** is your strategic reserve.

### How to use the Reserve:
1.  **Specialist Guest Stars:** Bring in an expert (e.g., "Cybersecurity Specialist") for a 1-day workshop.
    *   *Offer:* Flat RM 500 fee + **1% Profit Share**.
    *   *Why:* They promote the course to their audience to boost that 1%.
2.  **Second TA (Scaling to 20+ Students):**
    *   If intake size doubles, hire a second Junior Partner using the remaining **5% Kicker**.
3.  **Performance Bonus:**
    *   If no extra help is needed, this 5% acts as a "Super Performance Bonus" for the existing team if they hit NPS (Net Promoter Score) targets.

## Why this works
1.  **Variable Cost:** Your biggest wage bills scale up/down with revenue. You don't burn cash in bad months.
2.  **Tax Efficiency:** All payouts are deductible expenses for code:zero.
3.  **No Admin:** No share certificates, no board resolutions, no "divorce" legal fees.
