## Day 1: The Brain & The Senses (Saturday)

### Block 1: The External Brain (09:00 - 12:30)
*   **The Problem:** Your business knowledge is trapped in "Amnesia-prone" chat windows.
*   **The Build:** Initialize your **Omni-Brain Repository**.
*   **Key Tech:** Local SQLite, `/.claude/memory` architecture.
*   **Outcome:** A private knowledge vault where the AI "remembers" every strategy, pricing decision, and customer pain point you've ever mentioned.

### Block 2: The Model Context Protocol (13:30 - 17:00)
*   **The Problem:** AI can't "see" your real-world data (Databases, CRM, Browser).
*   **The Build:** Connect **MCP Servers**. 
*   **Key Tech:** Supabase MCP, Chrome MCP, Google Drive MCP.
*   **Outcome:** Your AI gains "Eyes and Hands." You can now say "Audit my database for churn" and it just happens.

### Block 4: The CEO Cockpit (13:30 - 17:00)
*   **The Problem:** You shouldn't have to look at code or terminal output.
*   **The Build:** Your custom **Streamlit Dashboard**.
