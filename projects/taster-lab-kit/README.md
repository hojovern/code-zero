# Welcome to the code:zero Lab Kit

You are now in your **Digital Site Office**. Today, you stop being a passenger and start being the Architect.

## 1. Prepare your Treats
Drop 3-5 photos of receipts into the `/receipts` folder. These are the raw materials for your engine.

## 2. Initialize the Site
Run the setup command in your terminal:
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

## 3. Glide into the Build
Now, command your AI Agent (the terminal assistant) to build your sniffer. 

**Example Command:**
> "Read the instructions in architecture.md. Build a script that sniffs all images in /receipts and generates a table in report.md with the vendor, date, and amount."

## 4. Why the Academy?
Today you built a **Sensor**. It's powerful, but it's manual.

In the **3-Day code:zero Academy** in Penang, we build the **Command Center**:
- **Day 1: The External Brain.** Move from text files to a professional SQLite Database.
- **Day 2: The Autonomous Staff.** Automate the triggers so you never have to run a terminal command again.
- **Day 3: The CEO Cockpit.** Build your own custom visual dashboard to track your margins in real-time.

**Ready to ship? See you in Georgetown.**
