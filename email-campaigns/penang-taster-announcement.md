# Email: The AI Architect’s Initiation (Penang Expansion)

**Subject:** I'm moving code:zero to George Town. Here's why.

**Audience:** KL CEO/Executive Network
**Tone:** Direct, High-Leverage, Builder-to-Builder

---

Hi [Name],

I’m in KL today, but next week I’m heading back to Penang. 

I’m opening the physical **code:zero Academy** in a heritage shop house in George Town. 

Why George Town? Because shipping real products requires a specific kind of focus that the KL noise tends to drown out. We’re building a "Digital Site Office" where founders stop being passengers of AI and start being the Architects of it.

Before we open the first full 4-week Intake, I’m running a series of 3-hour **AI Architect Initiations**.

**This is for you if:**
- You’re tired of "chatting" with AI and want to start **commanding** it.
- You have a "black hole" of administrative fodder (receipts, reports, data entry) that eats your executive time.
- You want to see what happens when a CEO opens a terminal.

### The 3-Hour Sprint
We won’t be learning theory. We will be sitting at a single "Command Table" in a 100-year-old shop on Malay Street. 

By the time you leave, you will have authored a custom **Financial Intelligence Sniffer**. It’s a tool that reads your pile of messy receipt photos, extracts the logic, and generates a structured report instantly.

**You keep the code.** It’s yours to use on Monday morning.

### The Details
- **Location:** George Town Heritage Zone, Penang (Exact Lab location revealed to attendees).
- **Format:** 8 Founders. 1 Table. 3 Hours.
- **Commitment:** RM 250 (The "Filter Fee").
- **The code:zero Multiplier:** Because I only want builders in the room, your RM 250 becomes a **RM 1,000 credit** toward the full code:zero Academy intake if you decide to join us.

I only have 12 seats per session. If you want to stop playing with AI toys and start building business machines, reply to this email or click below to claim a seat.

See you in Georgetown,
