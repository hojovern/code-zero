The Shipping Mindset

Most people spend months "learning to code."

Builders spend that time shipping.

Here's the difference:

Learner: "I need to understand everything first"
Builder: "I'll figure it out as I build"

Learner: "What if I make mistakes?"
Builder: "Mistakes are how I learn faster"

Which one are you?
