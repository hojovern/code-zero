1/ Standard AI writing is a "one-shot prompt" problem. You ask for a post, you get a generic average. 

Here is how we move beyond that using Agentic Workflows. 🧵

2/ In my recent experiments with Gizmo, I've found a 3-agent loop produces results 10x better than a single prompt. 

It starts with: The Topic Scout. 🔭

3/ The Scout doesn't write. It identifies "Expertise Gaps" in your vector memory. It finds what you *should* write about based on your unique knowledge.

4/ Next: The DNA Extractor. It analyzes *how* you write, not just what you say. 

Sentence length, signature vocabulary, and the "Banned Phrases" list. 🧬

5/ Finally: The Refinement Loop. A specialized Editor agent reviews the draft specifically for style violations. 

It kills the "AI-isms" and keeps the soul. 🧪

6/ Agents are our new logical units. Instead of complex if/else chains, we build chains of specialized reasoning. 🤖

7/ My rules for agentic writers:
- Isolation of Concerns
- Grounding in facts (Vector DB)
- Human-in-the-loop review

8/ Agents are the key to making AI tools feel like an extension of our craft, not a replacement.
